Module 5 - Networking and Content Delivery
-Networking-networks subnets, ipv4, CIDR, osi model

-Amazon VPC(virtual privae cloud)- logically isolated, vms, virtual networking resources, customize network configuration, multiple layers of security
 largest ipv4 block size /16, smallest /28       
 5 ip addresses are reserved by aws- Network address, internal communication, DNS resolution, Future use, Network bradcast address 
 Elastic IPs, Elastic network interface, public private subnets, each subnet-min 1 route table, multiple subnets can be mapped to same route table

-VPC Networking- Network address translation(NAT) gateway-allow resources in private subnet to access internet, VPC peering
 endpoints- Amazon S3 Amazon, DynamoDB
 Transit Gateway- topolgy becomes Hub

-VPC security- 1.security groups-firewall to EC2 instances, allow rules only, stateful, rules evaluated before decision
 2.network access control lists(ACL)-work at subnet level, aloow and deny rules, stateless, rules are evaluated in number order before decision

-Route53- register company domain and manage routing, 1.simple 2.weighted 3.latency 4.geolocation 5.geoproximity 6.failover 7.multivalue answer routing
