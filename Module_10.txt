Module 10 - Auto Scaling and Monitoring

-Elastic Load Balancing- distributes incoming network traffic in single or multiple availability zones
 configure to specify one or more listeners
 types- application(HTTPS HTTPS), network(TCP UDP), classic(HTTPS HTTPS TCP SSL)
 high available fault tolerant, containerized applications, elasticity scalability, VPC, hybrid environments, invoke lambda functions
 unhealthy target- stops routung traffic to that target and sends it to healthy target, resumes routing traffic to that target when it detecs that target is healthy again
 Monitoring this- CloudWatch metrics, Access logs, CloudTrail logs

-Amazon CloudWatch- Monitors, collects tracks, alarms(static threshold, anamoly detection, metric math expression), events 
 Amazon (SNS) simple notification service to send alerts for alarms

-Amazon CloudTrail- log of access to all services, governance, compliance, operational auditing, risk auditing

-Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling- maintain application availability, add remove EC2 instances
 manual, scheduled, dynamic(on demand), predictive
 auto scaling group- minimum and maximum number of instances, desired capacity
 responds to changing conditions by adding or terminating instances, launch instances from a specified AMI, enforces min mnumber of running Amazon EC2 instances
 for creation- AMI, instance type, EBS volumes

-AWS Auto Scaling(for other AWS services)- seperate service monitors applications, automatically adjust capacity
 steady, predictable performance at lowest cost
