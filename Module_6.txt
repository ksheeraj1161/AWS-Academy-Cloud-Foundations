Module 6 - Compute

-Compute services- (EC2) (Lambda) (ECR ECS EKS Fargate) (Elastic beanstalk) 

-EC2- instances-VMs can be launched on-demand, 
 AMI(amazon machine image) template for root volume for instances, launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use to launch instances, Block device mapping that specifies the  volume to attach to the instance when its launched
 1.AMI- 1.Quick start 2.My AMIs 3.AWS marketplace 4.community AMIs    New AMIs
 2.Instance type- to determine RAM CPU Storage Network performance    Categories- general, compute, memory, storage, accelerated
   Family name, generation number, size
 3.network settings
 4.attach IAM role
 5.User data script- bash script
 6.storage options- EBS, EC2 instance store
 7.Add tags
 8.Security groups- port number, protocol
 9.Key pair- public-aws stores, private key- you store

 instance metadata
 CloudWatch-monitor instances
 
-EC2 Cost Optimization
 ondemand, 
 spot, 
 reserved - run large amounts of data, long-term workloads with predictable usage patterns
 dedicated instances- will not share physical host with any othe customer instances
 pillars- Right size, increase elasticity, optimal pricing model, optimize storage choices

-Container based compute services- operating system virtualization, smaller than VMs
 Docker- build test deploy aplications, to control containers
 1. Amazon ECS(elastic container service)- container management service
 2. kubernetes- Deploy and manage contanierized applications - Amazon EKS
 Amazon ECR(elastic container registry)-manage docker registry

-AWS Lambda- serverless computing- run code without servers
 schedule based lambda function triggered, Event based lambda funtion
