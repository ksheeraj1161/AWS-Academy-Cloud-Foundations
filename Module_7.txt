Module 7 - Storage
-Amazon EBS(Elastic Block Store)- create individual storage volumes - block-change piece of file instead of complete file 
 Backup data is automayically replicated within an availability zone -snapshot,   Encryption solution, ELasticity
 quickly accesable, requiring long-term persistence, low latency
 persists when the isntance is stopped
 volume types- SSD, HDD
 cost- Volumes, IOPS, snapshots, data transfer

-AWS S3(Simple storage service)- objects in bucket, virtually unlimited storage, suitable for flat files(docs, photos)
 replicates all objects in multiple availability zones within same region, new bucket is associated with specific AWS region
 bucket name must be unique worldwide across all AWS accounts
 data stored is not viewable to public
 Classes: standard-high availability,frequent, Bigdata
 intelligent-Tiering - intelligently transfered unused, for data archiving
 Standard-infrequent access- long term
 one zone-infrequent access- less frequent but needed rapidly when needed, mostly for backups
 Glacier- not frequently accesed, preservation, retrieve options
 Glacier deep archive- retain data for years, backup
 Data access- Console, CLI, SDK

-AWS S3 Glacier- server side encryption
 vault-container for storing archives

-AWS EFS- file storage, multiple VM can access instances at the same time, users can share same data
 mount targets, tags(key value pair)
 create EC2 & launch-create EFS file system-Create mount targets in appropriate subnets-connect EC2 to mount targets-verify resources, protection
