Module 7 - Storage
-Amazon EBS(Elastic Block Store)- create individual storage volumes - block-change piece of file instead of complete file 
 Backup data is automayically replicated within an availability zone -snapshot,   Encryption solution, ELasticity
 quickly accesable, requiring long-term persistence, low latency
 persists when the isntance is stopped
 volume types- SSD, HDD
 cost- Volumes, IOPS, snapshots, data transfer
 
-AWS S3(Simple storage service)- objects in bucket, virtually unlimited storage, suitable for flat files(docs, photos)
 replicates all objects in multiple availability zones within same region, new bucket is associated with specific AWS region
 bucket name must be unique worldwide across all AWS accounts
 data stored is not viewable to public
 Classes: standard-high availability,frequent, Bigdata
 intelligent-Tiering - intelligently transfered unused, for data archiving
 Standard-infrequent access- long term
 one zone-infrequent access- less frequent but needed rapidly when needed, mostly for backups
 Glacier- not frequently accesed, preservation, retrieve options
 Glacier deep archive- retain data for years, backup
 Data access- Console, CLI, SDK
